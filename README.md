# Talia & Tots

My 8 (and soon to be 9) year old niece wants to start babysitting, but is still too young to be left alone with younger children. For her birthday this year, she asked me to build her a website to be a `mother's helper`, a name that I very much dislike. I gave her a quick rebrand for the 21st Century and here we are.

## CRA && MUI && Netlify

This Project is built with Create React App and Material UI. I worked through creating an e-mail form using [this tutorial](https://placidowang.medium.com/how-to-add-an-email-form-to-your-react-website-for-free-using-emailjs-and-react-hook-form-7267d6365291), and have pieced together some code from past projects that I have worked on such as [CITI](http://careerintech.ca) and [my personal website](http://connkat.com).

The website it deployed on Netlify, and there are no real bells and whistles here. Just a cute kid looking to market her business on the internet. I purchased this domain for her with the idea that I will pass it off to her when she turns 18 to use as needed as a resume or some weird metaverse reason.
